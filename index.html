    <p>I am an international student from China. I graduated from the University of Arizona in Management Information Systems.
      I also minored in <Mark>Statistics and Data Science</Mark> to explore data-related knowledge. These education experiences improved my learning ability
      and promoted my enthusiasm towards a new field.
      Now I am pursuing my master's degree at the <mark>University of Michigan School of Information in UX Research and Design track</mark>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I tried to use the sketch to finish an undergraduate course related to user experience, which is a rough start to my interaction design field.
      I also use procreate and photoshop to make some calligraphy and photos. My design philosophy is simple and attractive, sustainable.
      I think good design should attract people and must be sustainable. Additionally, simple has the power to draw attention and keep a memory.
